- 👋 Hi, I’m Sherry Wang. I live and work in Taiwan. 
- 👀 I’m interested in spending less time on overworking and not over the whole weekend;so, I can have time to develop others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML (including CSS,JAVA).
- 💞️ I’m looking to setting up my personal website. I have my own domain name, even renting a sort of VPS. Now I start to understand the rest parts by exploring what concerns me, without using Workpress, WIX, etc.It's quite hard to do it without any concept of IT knowledge. But, I take this way comfortablly. This year, I set my goal to HTML and java script. 
- 📫 How to reach me....when I decide to step out of selfing learning and not quit.
